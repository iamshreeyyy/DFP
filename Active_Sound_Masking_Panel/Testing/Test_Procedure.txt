ACTIVE SOUND MASKING – TEST PROCEDURE

1. Mount the panel with all electronics powered ON.
2. Place calibrated microphone at 1 meter distance.
3. Power on ESP32 and allow auto calibration (15 seconds).
4. Measure SPL using Room EQ Wizard (RTA mode).
5. Verify masking level remains between 38–44 dBA.
6. Introduce speech noise and confirm adaptive gain increase.
7. Ensure output never exceeds 48 dBA.
8. Repeat measurements at 5 spatial points.

Pass Criteria:

* Masking level: 38–44 dBA
* Spatial variation: ±2 dB
* Convergence time: ≤15 seconds
* No audible pumping or oscillation
