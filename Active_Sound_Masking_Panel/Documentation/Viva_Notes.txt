VIVA NOTES – ACTIVE SOUND MASKING

Q: Is this Active Noise Cancellation?
A: No. This is adaptive sound masking, not phase cancellation.

Q: Why pink noise?
A: Pink noise matches human hearing sensitivity and effectively masks speech.

Q: Why ESP32?
A: Compact, low-power, built-in I2S support, sufficient DSP capability.

Q: How is safety ensured?
A: Software limiter and hard gain ceiling prevent SPL above 48 dBA.

Q: Where are speakers placed?
A: Only in the PET felt layer to avoid compromising passive isolation.

Q: How does the system adapt?
A: RMS loudness measurement and PI-style feedback control adjust masking level.
